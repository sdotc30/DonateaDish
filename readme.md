## About the Project

**DonateADish** is a web-based platform that bridges the gap between food donors and NGOs serving underprivileged communities. Whether it's leftover food from events or surplus stock from restaurants, we help ensure it reaches people in needâ€”**instead of the landfill**.

### Why DonateADish?

Every day, **tons of edible food is wasted** while millions go to bed hungry. We decided to change that narrative with a tech-driven solution.

Our platform allows:
- **Individuals**, **restaurants**, and **event organizers** to **donate surplus food**
- **NGOs** to browse, claim, and request food donations in real-time
- **Users** to track donation statuses and get involved in meaningful social impact
