          Donating leftover food is a simple yet impactful way to help those in
          need. Our platform connects generous donors with local organizations
          and individuals who can make use of surplus food. By donating, you’re
          not only reducing food waste but also making a meaningful difference
          in someone’s life. Whether you have extra meals from an event, excess
          ingredients, or prepared food that’s still safe to eat, we’re here to
          facilitate the donation process, ensuring it reaches those who will
          benefit. Together, we can create a community of kindness and care, one
          meal at a time

      <h2>Current Scenario</h2>
      <div class="explanation">
        <p>
          On average, an Indian household wastes about 50 kg of food per person
          annually, amounting to millions of tonnes nationwide. Despite this,
          millions of people still suffer from hunger and malnutrition,
          highlighting a severe imbalance in food distribution. The lack of
          awareness, improper storage, and inefficient redistribution systems
          further worsen the problem. To tackle food waste, India needs stronger
          policies, public awareness campaigns, and better infrastructure for
          food recovery and donation initiatives. By implementing sustainable
          food practices at the household level, a significant reduction in food
          wastage can be achieved.
